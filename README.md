# Extinction-and-concentration-script
Uses txt files from Evolution 300 spectrometers and some user input to do calculation for empirical extinction coefficients and concentrations of compounds. This uses pandas dataframes as a structure and outputs the calculations as text and data values in a csv. One caviat for the script currently is that the gaussian error calculation portion has to be manually input for each value and tolerance.  Another thing missing is the filepaths for your input and output. Otherwise it has helped me process data fast and not waste 45 minutes using a calculator or a clunky excel sheet.
